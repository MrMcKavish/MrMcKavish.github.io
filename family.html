<h2>My family</h2>
<hr><p>
I have an amazing family of six, including me. My eight-year old brother, Shourya, goes to Live Oak Elementary School. My 
mom is very involved in what classes I do, and my dad loves to play sports with me. My two four-year old goldfish 
that are unnamed and my loving grandparents are also a very important part of my family.

  <h2>Why do I care about your family?</h2>
  <hr>
<p>
  I created this website about me so that people all around the world can better understand me. However, not everybody cares
about what I do, and if someone doesn't like this website, I don't care.
